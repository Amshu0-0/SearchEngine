Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a simplified search engine that can search through a set of article titles based on a user’s keyword input. We aim to implement both basic and advanced search functionalities, allowing users to perform tasks like limiting title length, retrieving a specific number of results, and checking if a favorite article is included in the search results. The project also focuses on ensuring robust testing through unit and integration tests.

What Each Person Will Do
Sadikshya Sapkota:
Focused on the integration testing for the search engine; Wrote tests to ensure the proper interaction between the different search functionalities and user input options; Specifically worked on verifying the correct behavior of advanced search options like random article retrieval and multiple keyword search.


Monika Basnet:
Handled the unit testing for each individual function; Created edge case tests for the search, title_length, article_count, and favorite_article functions; Ensured that each function behaves as expected with both typical and boundary inputs.

Amshu Wagle:
Implemented the main search functionalities; Coded the search, title_length, random_article, article_count, favorite_article, and multiple_keywords functions; Worked on integrating these functions into the display_result method that ties everything together.

Challenges and How You Overcame Them
Testing Random Article Functionality
Ensuring the random_article function returned consistent results during tests was tricky because of the random element. We overcame this by controlling the index input during testing instead of using actual random values, which made the tests more predictable.
